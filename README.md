# Calculator Project

This is a beginner-friendly Python program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It’s a great starting point for understanding Python programming concepts, including input/output, variables, and arithmetic operations.

## Features
The calculator supports the following operations:
- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (handles floating-point results).

## How to Use
Follow these steps to run the program:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hina-Atif/Python-Beginner-Projects.git
## Navigate to the Project Folder:
cd Python-Beginner-Projects
## Run the Calculator:
python Calculator.py
## Here’s a sample interaction with the program:
Enter the first number: 56
Enter the second number: 20
Addition: 76.0
Subtraction: 36.0
Multiplication: 1120.0
Division: 2.8
## Learning Objectives
This project demonstrates:

How to take user input in Python.
Performing arithmetic operations.
Printing formatted outputs.

## Future Improvements
In future versions, the calculator could include:

Additional operations like square root, exponentiation, and modulus.
Error handling for division by zero.
A graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
